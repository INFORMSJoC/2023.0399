## Instance Format

All instances follow the **BPP format**, where:

- The **first line** contains a single integer **N**, representing the number of items.  
- The **second line** contains a single integer **W**, representing the bin capacity.  
- The following **N** lines each contain a single integer, corresponding to the weight of one item.

Note: Items are not grouped by size and each has unit demand.
