## Instance Format

All instances follow the format:

- The **first line** contains a single integer **N**, representing the number of jobs.  
- The **second line** contains a single integer **K**, representing the number of identical parallel machines.  
- The following **N** lines each contain a single integer, corresponding to the processing time of each job.

Note: Each job appears individually (not grouped), and all machines are identical.
