## Description

In the paper, we present a general framework to address several cutting and packing problems, including:

- Cutting Stock Problem (CSP)
- Skiving Stock Problem (SSP)
- Identical Parallel Machines Scheduling with Minimum Makespan (IPMS)
- Ordered Open-End Bin Packing Problem (OOEBPP)
- Class-Constrained Bin Packing Problem (CCBPP)

---

## Requirements

In our experiments, all solvers were compiled using **GCC 11.4.0** and executed on **Ubuntu 22.04** with **Gurobi 10.0.1**.
By default, Gurobi is assumed to be installed in `/opt/gurobi1001/linux64`.

> If you are using a different installation path or a different version of Gurobi, please update the corresponding `Makefile` located at `src/<solver-name>/Makefile`.

---

## Running the Solver

You may run either a single instance or a complete set of instances. In our experiments, we used the Python scripts located in `scripts`, which:

1. Compile the solver and the solution checker
2. Execute the solver on each instance
3. Generate output files in `src/<solver-name>/out`:
   - `instance-name.gb`: Gurobi log file
   - `instance-name.log`: computed metrics
   - `instance-name.sol`: solution file

These scripts handle compilation and execution automatically for all instances in the set.

---

### Running a Single Instance Manually

To run a single instance manually, follow these steps:

```
cd src
make checkerCSP
cd CSPSolver
make
./CSPSolver ../../instances/CSP/AI202/201_2500_DI_0.txt ../checkerCSP
```
